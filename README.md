# easyxbrl

A python-based library which allows in-memory processing of financial data presented in native XML documents.

This approach is very interesting for ETL (extract, tranform, load) processing, OLAP and Data Mining techniques, in which a high performance is a very important point. There are no limits for how you can use it, this library provides every financial data in memory (from XBRL taxonomy), and you can manipulate these data as you want, as easy as a object-oriented python class.
